## Question 2

Chef Ada has a matrix with N rows (numbered 1 through N from top to bottom) and N columns (numbered 1 through N from left to right) containing all integers between 1 and N2 inclusive. For each valid i and j, let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column by (i,j).

Ada wants to sort the matrix in row-major order ― for each valid i and j, she wants the cell (i,j) to contain the value (i−1)⋅N+j.

In one operation, Ada should choose an integer L and transpose the submatrix between rows 1 and L and columns 1 and L (inclusive). Formally, for each i and j (1≤i,j≤L), the value in the cell (i,j) after this operation is equal to the value in (j,i) before it.

The initial state of the matrix is chosen in such a way that it is possible to sort it using a finite number of operations (possibly zero). Find the smallest number of operations required to sort the matrix.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The next N lines describe the matrix. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains N space-separated integers ― the initial values in cells (i,1),(i,2),…,(i,N).
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations required to sort the matrix.
